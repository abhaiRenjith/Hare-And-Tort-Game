# Hare and Tortoise Race Simulation

A simple console-based program that simulates a race between a hare and a tortoise.

## Description

This program uses random moves for the hare and the tortoise to simulate their race. The race continues until one of them reaches or exceeds a position of 70 or until a maximum number of turns (100) is reached.

## How to Run

Compile the source code and run the executable. The program will output the progress of the race, showing the positions of the hare (H) and the tortoise (T) at each turn.
